Remora.Discord.Caching.Abstractions
===================================

This package contains caching abstractions for Remora's internal implementation.
Primarily, it exposes an asynchronous cache interface, which can be used for
everything from in-memory to distributed cache services.

## Structure
There is a single interface with appropriate API surface for a cache provider.

## Usage
No specific usage is suggested. It is up to the user to implement and use a
cache provider.
