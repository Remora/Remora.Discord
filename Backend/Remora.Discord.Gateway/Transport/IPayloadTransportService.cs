/// This interface defines the public API surface for a type that the gateway client can use to send and receive
/// payloads from the Discord gateway. It is not specifically concerned with the actual protocol used underneath the

/// Some assumptions are made in regards to endpoints and availability of operations (one is expected to be able to
/// connect and disconnect separately from sending and receiving, for example), but generally, it is kept to a
/// minimum.
