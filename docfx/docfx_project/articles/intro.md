Welcome!
========

Hi, and welcome to the online documentation for Remora.Discord! Here, you'll
find everything you need to get started with the library - tutorials, API
references, and more.

To get started as a new user, it's recommended to check out
[Getting Started][1], where we'll go through setting up a basic bot with the
library.

If you're interested in contributing to the library, great! The best place to
start is by reading through the [contribution guidelines][2]. After that, check
out available and open issues on [GitHub][3], or come up with an idea of your
own.
