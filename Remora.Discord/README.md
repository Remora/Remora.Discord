Remora.Discord
==============

This package is a metapackage for Remora.Discord, providing references to 
everything you need to get started. Note that this package implies a dependency 
on the latest version of Remora.Discord's main packages, with no regard for API 
compatibility across builds.

Production packages/projects should probably prefer explicit dependencies 
instead.
